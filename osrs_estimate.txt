===================================================
TOTAL ESTIMATE:                              742,000-1,146,000 lines

REALISTIC MIDDLE:                            ~900,000 lines
===================================================

COMPARISON:
- Flux Compiler:     ~600,000 lines
- OSRS Clone:        ~900,000 lines
- OSRS is 1.5x LARGER ✓

WHY LARGER:
✓ 23 skills with unique mechanics
✓ 200+ quests (narrative scripting)
✓ 20,000+ items with interactions
✓ Massive content (vs algorithmic compiler)
✓ Complex MMO networking
✓ Social/economic systems
✓ Persistent world state

WHY FLUX COULD BE HARDER:
✓ Algorithms are deeper (Hindley-Milner, borrow checking)
✓ Correctness critical (compiler bugs = broken programs)
✓ Performance critical (compile time matters)
✓ Less room for "good enough"

VERDICT: OSRS is LARGER but SIMPLER
- More code (content-heavy)
- Less algorithmic complexity
- More forgiving (bugs = gameplay issues, not crashes)
