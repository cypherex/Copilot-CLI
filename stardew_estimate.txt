- Flux Compiler:     ~600,000 lines
- OSRS Clone:        ~900,000 lines
- Stardew Valley:    ~650,000 lines

STARDEW vs FLUX:
Similar size but VERY different complexity!

STARDEW CHARACTERISTICS:
✓ Mostly content and game rules
✓ Simpler algorithms (no PhD required)
✓ More forgiving (bugs = quirks)
✓ Lots of data (items, NPCs, dialogue)
✓ State machines & scheduling
✗ No deep CS theory
✗ Single-player (no networking)
✗ 2D (simpler than 3D)

FLUX CHARACTERISTICS:
✓ Deep algorithms (type theory)
✓ Correctness critical
✓ Performance critical
✓ Less content, more logic
✗ Unforgiving (compiler bugs fatal)

VERDICT: Similar LOC, but Stardew is MUCH easier
- More straightforward logic
- Can prototype & iterate
- Bugs are less catastrophic
- Parallelizable (each system independent)
