You: Create OldSchool Runescape from scratch in rust, with all content

🤔 Processing your request...
Assistant:
This is an incredibly ambitious project! Old School RuneScape is a complex MMORPG with thousands of items, hundreds of quests, 23 skills, complex combat systems, networking, and much more.

Let me create a structured approach to build this systematically. I'll start by creating a root task and breaking it down into major components.
