# Testbox

This directory contains test prompts and documentation generated by different AI models for a Distributed Task Queue System.

## Purpose

The testbox serves as a testing ground for generating and comparing documentation and implementation specifications across different AI models. It contains:

- **Task specifications** (prompt.md) - Complete requirements for building a distributed task queue system
- **Generated documentation** - API references, architecture docs, deployment guides
- **Implementation status tracking** - Progress reports and completion summaries

## Usage

### For Developers

When reviewing generated documentation:

1. Start with the master specification in `testbox/prompt.md` to understand the requirements
2. Compare outputs across different model directories (haiku, sonnet, GLM) to see:
   - Different approaches to the same problem
   - Variations in documentation style and detail
   - Model-specific insights and recommendations

### For Testing AI Models

To add tests for a new model:

1. Create a new directory: `testbox/<model-name>/`
2. Copy the base prompt: `cp testbox/prompt.md testbox/<model-name>/`
3. Generate documentation using the model's responses
4. Organize outputs in the model's `docs/` subdirectory
5. Update this README with any model-specific notes

## Model-Specific Notes

### Haiku
- More concise documentation
- Lowercase filenames in docs/ directory
- Focus on practical implementation details

### Sonnet
- More verbose and comprehensive documentation
- Uppercase filenames in docs/ directory
- Includes IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md summary
- More detailed examples and explanations

### GLM
- Minimal documentation (only prompt.md)
- Can be used for future testing

## Shared Specification

The `testbox/prompt.md` file contains the complete specification for a **Distributed Task Queue System** written in Rust. This is a comprehensive document that includes:

- Task definition and serialization requirements
- Message broker specifications
- Persistence layer design (RocksDB)
- Worker pool architecture
- API server requirements (REST + gRPC)
- Client library specifications
- Admin CLI requirements
- Security and monitoring requirements
- Performance targets
- Testing requirements

This specification is used to test each model's ability to:
1. Understand complex technical requirements
2. Generate coherent project documentation
3. Provide implementation guidance
4. Create API references and architecture guides

## Consolidation Status

The following redundancies have been identified:

### Duplicate Files (Removed)
- `testbox/haiku/prompt.md` → Kept in root
- `testbox/sonnet/prompt.md` → Kept in root
- `testbox/GLM/prompt.md` → Kept in root

### Consolidatable Content

The following documentation exists in both haiku and sonnet directories with minor variations:

1. **README.md** - Similar project overviews
2. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Nearly identical contribution guidelines
3. **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md** - Similar implementation summaries
4. **docs/api.md** vs **docs/API.md** - Same content, different filenames
5. **docs/architecture.md** vs **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md** - Same content, different filenames
6. **docs/deployment.md** vs **docs/DEPLOYMENT.md** - Same content, different filenames

**Recommendation**: Consolidate these into shared documentation with model-specific notes for differences.

## Maintenance

When updating testbox:

1. Update the master specification in `testbox/prompt.md`
2. Consider whether changes require regenerating model-specific documentation
3. Keep model-specific notes in this README to track unique behaviors
4. Remove obsolete or redundant files promptly
