# Haiku Model Test Results

This directory contains documentation and implementation guidance generated by **Amazon Haiku** model for Distributed Task Queue System.

## Model Characteristics

**Haiku** generated documentation with these characteristics:
- More concise and to-the-point explanations
- Lowercase filenames (following Unix conventions)
- Focus on practical implementation details
- Clear, straightforward code examples

## Documentation Structure

The detailed technical documentation has been consolidated into the shared `testbox/docs/` directory:

- `testbox/docs/api.md` - Complete REST and gRPC API reference
- `testbox/docs/architecture.md` - System architecture and component descriptions
- `testbox/docs/deployment.md` - Deployment guides for production
- `testbox/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines

This directory (`testbox/haiku/`) serves as a marker for Haiku's test results. The actual content has been consolidated to reduce redundancy.

## Master Specification

The complete requirements specification is in:
- **`testbox/prompt.md`** - Full system requirements

## What Makes Haiku Unique

Compared to other models (like Sonnet), Haiku's output tends to:
- Be more succinct in explanations
- Focus on essential information
- Use simpler examples
- Provide clear, actionable guidance
